# hello-world
in Code we trust

Hello there! Isn't that simple to say this greeting's message? 
Well, it's not as common if you don't know the language of speaking at all!
I believe you get to know a person better, if you ask about the languages he speaks. It would be nice if people could get to know each other better so they would share their goals, interests, experience. And since this platform is mostly about of how "people learn, share, and work together to build software" (https://github.com/about), it is a good opportunity to start this adventurous journey towards and along with GitHub and its community by sharing the information about the programming languages in which I can say hello at this first day.
List of "How I would say 'Hello there!' in different languages":
1) Bash:
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo 'Hello there!'
*
2) C:
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
  printf("Hello there!\n");
}
**
3) C++:
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello there!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
***
4) Java:
class HelloThere {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello there!");
  }
}
*** *
5) HTML:
<p>Hello there!</p>
*** **
6) CoffeeScript:
console.log 'Hello, world!'
*** ***
7) JavaScript:
document.write('Hello there!');
*** *** *
8) jQuery:
$("body").append("Hello there!");
*** *** **
9) PHP:
<? php 
  echo 'Hello there!';
?>
*** *** ***
There are 9 programming languages I can "speak", in total. Tolerant but not great. And my main purpose of joining this community, at this point, is to improve this result, both ways: 
1. Latitude: more languages I can speak, more versatile tasks I am able to perform.
2. Depth: it's always good to know of how to start a dialogue. But I also have to know how to continue it. Delving into different programming area, hope I'll be able to become better I am right now.

Let's help each other!
